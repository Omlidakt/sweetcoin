# Expleo Test: Christian Coyle

## How to get started

1. `open your terminal`
2. `cd` to a directory of your choice
		2.a (if you have the git CLI installed)
	`git clone` [paste in this repos slug on the top right of this page.]
		2.b Or download directly
3. Navigate into the directory and double click on index.html

For brevity sake there is no server side code at all, it's designed to *just run*.


## Features 
**Frontend** 
 - [X] Mobile First Design
 - [X] Pleasing Aesthetics 
 - [X] Contains the relevant information as per the API requests from CoinGecko.
 - [X] Pagination

**Unit Testing**
- [X] Small unit testing class methods written by me so I wouldn't have to import and entire library.
- [X]  Unit tests of API requests and page functionality.

## Learnings and snags

 1. Using Web Components contains an obnoxious anti-pattern , you have to use`@import(my-global-css-here)`as the shadow DOM doesn't allow you to inherit a global stylesheet. Which sucks sometimes.

## Plan
To build a single page application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**Aesthetics**
 - I would like to use Bootstrap for the UI as its quick and easy to get something up and running.

**HTML**

 - I plan to use HTML `<templates>` to build repeat DOM elements to make reusable "components" where it makes sense to do so.
 - I am to make use of bootstrap components
 - Where possible I need to think of design concerns such as accessibility.
 
 **CSS**
 - I will use `Figma` to wireframe up the design and then appropriately apply css styling via classes to DOM elements inside my single page application.

**Javascript**

- I aim to make a small assertion function to unit test my code instead of importing an entire library for something so basic.
- I will use JavaScript `fetch` to perform a `GET` request to CoinGecko for both `market` and individual `coin` data.

## Problem Restatement
Original Statement
> Please create single page application â€“ html, CSS, javascript

I am required to create a single page application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that shows a list of cryptocurrencies available on CoinGecko. 

When you click on a single cryptocurrency it provides additional information on that particular coin.

To solve this problem I need to make a pretty frontend that is easy to navigate, responsive to desktop computers and calls from a public API.

### Security Concerns
Usually, it is best practice to include authentication on the server side when calling an API. In this particular instance:
1. It is a `GET` request.
2. It is a publicly accessible endpoint.
3. Therefore I'm not worried about calling the API directly using JavaScript on the client, although I aim to adhere to any throttling limits as common courtesy.

## Todolist

 **Layout** (In Figma)
 - [X]  Block out Header, Nav, Main and Footer
 - [X] Decide on Header look and feel
 - [X] Decide on Nav look and feel
 - [X] Decide on Main look and feel
 - [X] Decide on Footer look and feel
 
 **Components**
 
 - [X] List Container
 - [X] Coin Card
	 - [X] Header 
		 - [X] Name 
		 - [X] Symbol
		 - [X] Image
	 - [X] Footer
		 - [X] Current Price (Formatted in EUR)
		 - [X] Daily High
		 - [X] Daily Low
 - [X] Display extra information(main)
	 (On the interaction with one of the cards)
	 - [X] Header
		 - [X] Name 
		 - [X] Symbol
		 - [X] Hashing Algorithm
	 - [X] Body
		- [X] Description
		- [X] Market Cap
		- [X] Genesis Date
		- [ ] Ticker Chart or Sparkline (nice to have)
		 - [X] Homepage (located in title of coin)

**JavaScript**

**Unit Testing Functions**

- [X] Assert Class
	- [X] Deep Equals (Type checking)
	- [X] Check if a string contains something of interest
	- [X] Check the keys inside of an object
- [X] Test Runner Class
	- [X]  Store all the tests to be run
	
## User Flow
1. The user is displayed with the markets on the page.
2. If the user presses one of the markets it displays more information about that particular coin. 
3. The list is hidden from view and the information is presented instead in a `<div>`.
