# Expleo Test: Christian Coyle

## How to get started

1. `open your terminal`
2. `cd` to a directory of your choice
        2.a (if you have the git CLI installed)
    `git clone` [paste in this repos slug on the top right of this page.]
        2.b Or download directly
3. Navigate into the directory and double click on index.html

For brevity sake there is no server side code at all, it's designed to *just run*.
